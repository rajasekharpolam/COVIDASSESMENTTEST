Steps have taken care to run standalone GUI application
Note : Make sure python is greater than 3.5 version
(i) Due to my Personel PC limitations to have installed Anaconda which is having inbuilt  Python (> 3.5) distribution used  
	https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

(ii)  To support GUI kind of application need to install wx package try the below command in the anaconda prompt  .
	pip install wxPython
	
(iii) Have used Command line approach to launch application so go to the path where the Assement.py is existed and run in below manner.
	
	Ex:
	C:\Users\rajasekhar\Downloads\wx\Assementtest python Assessment.py
	Path is C:\Users\rajasekhar\Downloads\wx\Assementtest
